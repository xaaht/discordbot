## Public sample bot for Discord servers ðŸ˜Ž
Bot is written in Java 16, currently there is only verification in the bot, but if someone knows at least the basics of Java will probably add some features.

**How to run the bot?**
The first step is to change the bot token which you will find on https://discord.com/developers/applications, you must have java 16 installed on your computer - once all the steps are done you are able to run the bot using it: **java -jar app.jar**

**Do you have a question? write on discord zellzik#1337!**

If I made, a mistake in the readme I apologize, I was using a translator.
